# Development

This web application is written in javascript.

We use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to ensure we develop against the correct node version. If you do not want to install and use nvm, make sure that the node version listed in `.nvmrc` matches your currently installed node version. You can veroify this using the `node --version` command. If you do not have node installed, see [https://nodejs.org/en/download/]()

```
nvm use
npm install
node index.js
```
